-- Example output:

Here is a suggested itinerary for your day in San Francisco:

<response> [ { "location_name": "Fisherman's Wharf", "location_address": "2850 Taylor St, San Francisco, CA 94133", "start_time": {"09:00"}, "end_time": {"10:00"} }, { "location_name": "Lombard Street", "location_address": "Lombard St, San Francisco, CA 94123", "start_time": {"10:30"}, "end_time": {"11:30"} }, { "location_name": "Pier 39", "location_address": "Beach St &, The Embarcadero, San Francisco, CA 94133", "start_time": {"12:00"}, "end_time": {"12:30"} } ] </response>
I excluded Golden Gate Park per your request, and selected popular tourist destinations within 5km of each other that can be seen within an hour. I left 30 minutes of travel time between locations and started at 9am, ending before 12:30pm. Please let me know if you would like me to modify the itinerary in any way!
